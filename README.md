SOX Risk Engine - AI-Powered Compliance Automation


Automate SOX compliance assessments with AI-driven risk analysis and control testing

The SOX Risk Engine is an AI-powered solution that transforms weeks of manual SOX compliance work into automated 90-second assessments. Built by auditors for auditors, this engine uses OpenAI's GPT models to analyze control failures, generate risk statements, and create audit-ready documentation with industry-specific logic.
